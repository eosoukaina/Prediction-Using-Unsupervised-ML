# Iris Flower Clustering with K-Means

This project illustrates the application of K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method, to analyze the Iris dataset and predict its clustering.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-established dataset in machine learning, comprising 150 observations of iris flowers. Each observation includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is categorized into three distinct classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolour, and Iris-virginica.
In this project, K-Means clustering is employed to group iris flowers into three clusters based on their feature similarities.

## Requirements

To execute this project, ensure you have the following installed:

    - Python 3.x
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

The project directory includes the following files:
main.py: This script performs K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset and visualizes the resulting clusters.

 ## Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:
   1- Clone the repository:
```
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML.git
cd Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
Run the script:
```
   2- Copy code python main.py
The script will execute the following tasks:

   - Load the Iris dataset.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
   - Apply K-Means clustering to classify the iris flowers into three clusters.
   - Visualize the clusters and their centroids.
     
By running main.py, you will observe how K-Means clustering categorizes the Iris dataset based on its features, revealing natural groupings within the data.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to enhance your understanding of unsupervised machine learning and clustering techniques.
