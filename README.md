# 🌸 Iris Flower Clustering with K-Means
🚀 Unsupervised Machine Learning in Action

This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, can be applied to the Iris dataset to uncover natural groupings among iris flowers based on their characteristics.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each described by four features:
✔ Sepal Length
✔ Sepal Width
✔ Petal Length
✔ Petal Width

The dataset is categorized into three species:
🌿 Iris-setosa
🌿 Iris-versicolour
🌿 Iris-virginica

In this project, we use K-Means clustering to automatically group the flowers into three clusters based on their feature similarities.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

🔹 Python 3.x
🔹 NumPy (pip install numpy)
🔹 Pandas (pip install pandas)
🔹 Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
🔹 Scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)

You can install all dependencies at once using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ Running the Project
Follow these steps to clone and run the project:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML.git
cd Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
```
### 2️⃣ Run the Script
```bash
python main.py
```
## 📊 What Happens When You Run the Script?
✅ Loads the Iris dataset
✅ Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
✅ Applies K-Means clustering to classify iris flowers into three clusters
✅ Visualizes the clusters and their centroids

By executing main.py, you'll see how K-Means clustering groups the iris flowers based on their features, revealing natural patterns in the data.
